# Instagram Mobile
### A chrome extension that turns instagram.com into the mobile version

#### How?
Basically this plugin is replacing the user agent wherever it exists (all requests to instagram, and setting page getters for them) to be a mobile User Agent.

#### Why?
This was an intermediary step to something else I am working on so I thought I would publish the work for this as well.
Some things this may help you with:
- Far higher threshold before comments get restricted
- Photo uploading
- mobile / app like interface

#### What doesn't it do?
This is be no means a replacement for the isntagram app, this still doesn't allow for direct messaging and probably a good bit of other features. It's only capable of what instagram.com in your phone browser is capable of.

#### Where do I get it?
